# Flutter Tether example

Go into the `/backend` directory and run the following command to start the
Supabase project:

```bash
supabase start
```

Then, go into the `/frontend` directory and run the following command to start
the Flutter app:

```bash
dart run flutter_tether --config tether_config.yaml
```

This will generate the necessary files in the `lib/database` directory.

Finally, run the Flutter app:

```bash
flutter run
```
